		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<div class="about_content">
			<p>online shopping or e-shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or services from a seller over the Internet using a web-browser. English entrepreneur Michael Aldrich invented online shopping in 1979. His system connected a modified domestic TV to a real-time transaction processing computer via domestic telephone line.The key drivers for the boost of online shopping sector are increasing broadband internet penetration/usage, rising standard of living with high disposable income, availability of much wider product range compared to what is available in the market, busy lifestyle leading to lack of time for offline shopping and relatively lower prices of the products. Generally, higher levels of education, metropolitan cities and personal income correspond to more favourable perceptions of shopping online. Delhi ranks first in e-shopping followed by Mumbai and Ahmedabad.Technology is more often accompanied with disadvantages and online shopping is no exception. The internet is prone to cybercrimes and online shopping is facilitated through this internet only. Cyber criminals like identity thieves prowl the internet looking for unsuspecting targets to steal their credit card details. Armed with sophisticated hacking and tracking software, they break the security protocols and access confidential credit card information which they use to their benefit. Many people are thus very wary of online shopping because of the risks involved in them.</p>
